We ask whether large error growth can occur if unfavorable conditions persist for several iterations. Pathological examples show serious loss of accuracy, which is worse for the Fletcher-Matthews algorithm. However, the calculations that may have large errors are less easy to recognize automatically if the Bartels-Golub algorithm is preferred. Some numerical results confirm the growth of errors, but they are atypical of ordinary calculations.}

In this paper, we review the different strategies and technologies added in Glucose over the years. We detail each technique and discuss its impact on the final performances reached by Glucose. We also come back on one of the main developments of the solver over the very last years: its efficient parallelization. We extensively tested different versions of Glucose and Syrup (its parallel version) on all the benchmarks since 2011. By including, as a reference, the SAT solver Lingeling (and its parallel version Plingeling), we show that Glucose and Syrup are significantly faster than other solvers, even if they can solve fewer instances.}

Here “reduced” means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

First, we define a new concept called formal tableau, which leads to derive easily the dual solution from the latest primal table; without any distinction between the original variables and the slack ones. Second, we propose a new method for initializing the simplex algorithm. Unlike the two-phase and the big-M methods, our technique does not involve artificial variables. The computational results reveal that this new method is very favorable especially when the number of artificial variables is significant. Finally, this method will be combined with the notion of formal tableau leading naturally to a second new approach.}

  abstract = {Since the elimination algorithm of Fourier and Motzkin, many different methods have been developed for solving linear programs. When analyzing the time complexity of LP algorithms, it is typically either assumed that calculations are performed exactly and bounds are derived on the number of elementary arithmetic operations necessary, or the cost of all arithmetic operations is considered through a bit-complexity analysis. Yet in practice, implementations typically use limited-precision arithmetic. In this paper we introduce the idea of a limited-precision LP oracle and study how such an oracle could be used within a larger framework to compute exact precision solutions to LPs. Under mild assumptions, it is shown that a polynomial number of calls to such an oracle and a polynomial number of bit operations, is sufficient to compute an exact solution to an LP. This work provides a foundation for understanding and analyzing the behavior of the methods that are currently most effective in practice for solving LPs exactly.},

  abstract = {This article studies a combination of the two state-of-the-art algorithms for the exact solution of linear programs (LPs) over the rational numbers in practice, that is, without any roundoff errors or numerical tolerances. By integrating the method of precision boosting inside an LP iterative refinement loop, the combined algorithm is able to leverage the strengths of both methods: the speed of LP iterative refinement, in particular, in the majority of cases when a double-precision floating-point solver is able to compute approximate solutions with small errors, and the robustness of precision boosting whenever extended levels of precision become necessary. We compare the practical performance of the resulting algorithm with both pure methods on a large set of LPs and mixed-integer programs (MIPs). The results show that the combined algorithm solves more instances than a pure LP iterative refinement approach while being faster than pure precision boosting. When embedded in an exact branch-and-cut framework for MIPs, the combined algorithm is able to reduce the number of failed calls to the exact LP solver to zero while maintaining the speed of the pure LP iterative refinement approach.History: Accepted by Antonio Frangioni, Area Editor for Design and Analysis of Algorithms: Continuous.Funding: The work for this article has been conducted within the Research Campus Modal funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [Grants 05M14ZAM and 05M20ZBM]. }

  abstract        = {This paper studies the design of controllers that guarantee stability and safety of nonlinear control affine systems with parametric uncertainty in both the drift and control vector fields. To this end, we introduce novel classes of robust control barrier functions (RCBF) and robust control Lyapunov functions (RCLF) that facilitate the synthesis of safety-critical controllers in the presence of parametric uncertainty using quadratic programming. Since the initial bounds on the system uncertainty may be highly conservative, we present a data-driven approach to reducing such bounds using input-output data collected online. In particular, we leverage an integral set-membership identification algorithm that iteratively shrinks the set of possible system parameters online and guarantees stability and safety during learning. The efficacy of the developed approach is illustrated via numerical examples.},

  abstract        = {In this paper, we study the minimax estimation of the Bochner integral (Equation Presented) also called as the kernel mean embedding, based on random samples drawn i.i.d. from P, where k : X × X → ℝ is a positive definite kernel. Various estimators (including the empirical estimator), $\theta$n of µk(P) are studied in the literature wherein all of them satisfy ∥$\theta$n-µk(P)∥Hk = OP(n-1/2) with Hk being the reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by k. The main contribution of the paper is in showing that the above mentioned rate of n-1/2 is minimax in ∥{\textperiodcentered} ∥Hk and ∥{\textperiodcentered} ∥L2(ℝd)-norms over the class of discrete measures and the class of measures that has an infinitely differentiable density, with k being a continuous translation-invariant kernel on ℝd. The interesting aspect of this result is that the minimax rate is independent of the smoothness of the kernel and the density of P (if it exists).},

  abstract        = {We show that polynomials do not belong to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of infinitely differentiable translation-invariant kernels whose spectral measures have moments corresponding to a determinate moment problem. Our proof is based on relating this question to the problem of best linear estimation in continuous time one-parameter regression models with a stationary error process defined by the kernel. In particular, we show that the existence of a sequence of estimators with variances converging to 0 implies that the regression function cannot be an element of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This question is then related to the determinacy of the Hamburger moment problem for the spectral measure corresponding to the kernel. In the literature it was observed that a nonvanishing constant function does not belong to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with the Gaussian kernel. Our results provide a unifying view of this phenomenon and show that the mentioned result can be extended for arbitrary polynomials and a broad class of translation-invariant kernels.},

  abstract        = {This paper presents a safe learning framework that employs an adaptive model learning algorithm together with barrier certificates for systems with possibly nonstationary agent dynamics. To extract the dynamic structure of the model, we use a sparse optimization technique. We use the learned model in combination with control barrier certificates that constrain policies (feedback controllers) in order to maintain safety, which refers to avoiding particular undesirable regions of the state space. Under certain conditions, recovery of safety in the sense of Lyapunov stability after violations of safety due to the nonstationarity is guaranteed. In addition, we reformulate an action-value function approximation to make any kernel-based nonlinear function estimation method applicable to our adaptive learning framework. Lastly, solutions to the barrier-certified policy optimization are guaranteed to be globally optimal, ensuring the greedy policy improvement under mild conditions. The resulting framework is validated via simulations of a quadrotor, which has previously been used under stationarity assumptions in the safe learnings literature, and is then tested on a real robot, the brushbot, whose dynamics is unknown, highly complex, and nonstationary.},

We propose hybrid control barrier functions for hybrid systems as a means to synthesize safe control inputs. Based on this notion, we present an optimization-based framework to learn such hybrid control barrier functions from data. Importantly, we identify sufficient conditions on the data such that feasibility of the optimization problem ensures correctness of the learned hybrid control barrier functions, and hence the safety of the system.
