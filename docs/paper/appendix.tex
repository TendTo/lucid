    \section{Proofs}
    We have collected a series of proofs of the claims we made in the main text.

    \section{Benchmarks}
    \label{app:benchmarks}
    Complete list of results for the benchmarks presented in \autoref{sec:benchmarks}.
    The legend is as follows:
    \textit{Output} indicates the result produced by the solver (i.e., optimal, unbounded, infeasible or unspecified),
    \textit{Prec} indicates the number of bits used in the last floating-point number representation,
    \textit{Ref} indicates the number of refinements,
    and \textit{time} is the time in seconds.
